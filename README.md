# Retail Sales Dashboard (Excel)

## 📌 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to design an **Excel-based Retail Sales Dashboard** that focuses on **real business questions**, not just visuals. Instead of adding random charts, the dashboard is built around **key KPIs and actionable insights** that help decision-makers understand performance, customer behavior, and sales trends.

This project demonstrates how Excel can be used as a **powerful business intelligence tool** using Pivot Tables, KPIs, charts, slicers, and hyperlinks.

## 🔥 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The dashboard starts with high-level KPIs to give a quick snapshot of business health:

* **Total Revenue** – Overall sales performance
* **Total Orders** – Total number of transactions
* **Average Order Value (AOV)** – Average spending per order

> **AOV Formula:**
> `Average Order Value = Total Revenue / Total Orders`

These KPIs help stakeholders instantly understand whether the business is growing or slowing down.
